                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Protecting your bed is the most important aspect of Bedwars. Without a bed, you cannot respawn, making it critical to defend it effectively.</p>
                
                <h3>Step 1: Gather Resources</h3>
                <p>Start by collecting iron and gold from your island's generators. Use these to purchase wool or wood from the shop.</p>
                
                <h3>Step 2: Build a Basic Defense</h3>
                <p>Surround your bed with layers of wool or wood. Wool is cheap and quick to place, making it ideal for early-game defense.</p>
                
                <h3>Step 3: Upgrade Your Defense</h3>
                <p>As you gather more resources, add stronger materials like end stone or obsidian. Use emeralds to buy obsidian for the ultimate protection.</p>
                
                <h3>Tips</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Always leave a small entrance to your bed so you can escape if needed.</li>
                    <li>Place traps like mining fatigue or alarm traps to alert you of enemies.</li>
                    <li>Work with your team to defend the bed while others gather resources.</li>

                <p>Efficient resource management can give you a significant advantage in Bedwars. Knowing what to collect and when to spend is key.</p>
                
                <h3>Step 1: Prioritize Iron and Gold</h3>
                <p>Focus on collecting iron and gold early in the game. These resources are essential for basic items like wool, tools, and armor.</p>
                
                <h3>Step 2: Collect Emeralds Strategically</h3>
                <p>Once your base is secure, head to the center islands to collect emeralds. Use them to buy powerful items like obsidian or diamond swords.</p>
                
                <h3>Step 3: Spend Wisely</h3>
                <p>Don’t waste resources on unnecessary items. For example, only buy a pickaxe if you need to break through enemy defenses.</p>
                
                <h3>Tips</h3>
                <ul>

                <h3>Step 2: Upgrade Your Gear</h3>

                <p>Learn to place blocks while moving backward or sideways. This allows you to bridge faster without falling.</p>
                
                <h3>Step 2: Master Ninja Bridging</h3>
